          My name is Bradley Peterson. This webpage is one that I designed
          myself and then created using html as well as css. It contains links
          to the webpages that I have created for my Web Development class at
          Brigham Young University - Idaho. The links at the top can be used to
          find those pages or learn more about me. Currently this webpage is
          still being developed so some links aren't connected to any pages and
          some elements lack css styling. I hope to finish this page soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's another paragraph just to add some content to the page. Isn't
          it cool? Yeah, I thought so too. That's the reason for its addition
          here. It comes right after a much better paragraph but I love them
          equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oops. I just added <i>another</i> paragraph to my project but this one
          uses a little bit of italic text. Ooh. Fancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This paragraph just exists so I can make sure that the text is
          wrapping around the
          <i>definitely real</i> picture of myself. Does it work? I haven't
          checked yet, but I will once I finish this sentence.
